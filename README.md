# Kaggle Titanic Competition
Here I apply random forests to the Titanic Kaggle dataset in order to predict if passengers survive or die. The competition page and dataset may be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).


## Requirements
I use the fastai library used for in the fastai Machine Learning Course. It is located [here](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) under the directory `old/fastai`.

I use Anaconda to create the `environment-cpu.yml` environment found in the fastai git repo.
